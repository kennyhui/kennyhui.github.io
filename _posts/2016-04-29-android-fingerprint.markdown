 To authenticate users via fingerprint scan, get an instance of the new FingerprintManager class and call the authenticate() method. Your app must be running on a compatible device with a fingerprint sensor. You must implement the user interface for the fingerprint authentication flow on your app, and use the standard Android fingerprint icon in your UI. The Android fingerprint icon (c_fp_40px.png) is included in the Fingerprint Dialog sample. If you are developing multiple apps that use fingerprint authentication, note that each app must authenticate the userâ€™s fingerprint independently.

To use this feature in your app, first add the USE_FINGERPRINT permission in your manifest.

    <uses-permission
            android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT" />

To see an app implementation of fingerprint authentication, refer to the Fingerprint Dialog sample. For a demonstration of how you can use these authentication APIs in conjunction with other Android APIs, see the video Fingerprint and Payment APIs.

If you are testing this feature, follow these steps:

Install Android SDK Tools Revision 24.3, if you have not done so.
Enroll a new fingerprint in the emulator by going to Settings > Security > Fingerprint, then follow the enrollment instructions.
Use an emulator to emulate fingerprint touch events with the following command. Use the same command to emulate fingerprint touch events on the lockscreen or in your app.
adb -e emu finger touch <finger_id>
On Windows, you may have to run telnet 127.0.0.1 <emulator-id> followed by finger touch <finger_id>.
